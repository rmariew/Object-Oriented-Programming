1.  We declare an interface by making a class that strictly has public memeber variables that are all pure virtual.
3a. This is an example of interface inheritance.
3b. It should be private 
4. We created a vector<char> variable that contained "lo" and used that to test both write() and append() so that contents contained "lolo",
	and we made sure of this by using read(), and it printed out "lolo" to the terminal. We also printed both getSize() and getName(), which returned their expected output.
5. We dynamically declared a pointer of type AbstractFile to an object of type TextFile, and accessed all of the functions by pointing to them.
