2. Test cases:
	getSize - printed to the console and accurately returned the "size" member variable
	getName - printed to the console and accurately returned the "name" member variable
	write- tested by writing a vector containing {'X', 'X', ' ', 'X', '2'} into an imageFile object, and printing it out with the read() method
	append- printed to the console and succesfully returned a non-zero value
	read- correctly printed to the console the contents of the imageFile object {'X', 'X', ' ', 'X', '2'}
3. It is better to create an interface rather than a class because an interface provides a template for what future derived classes 
need to be able to do, but allows us to think of the implementation of the derived classes individually.
4. We would need to add code to the createFile method.
